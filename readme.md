# JS breakout tutorial
This is a project built from a tutorial which can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript).

I don't plan on extending it further, although I probably should.

I will definitely look into using the html canvas for making games though! Keep an eye on this space as I work on more projects.
